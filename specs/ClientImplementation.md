# Client-side Library

To be able to meet the specifications of the "updates" section of the README
(especially the bits about 'No Reboots', 'Updates should be applied while the
app is running'), we have to be a bit more clever than "Stuff everything in a
folder, hit go".

### How can you replace DLLs while they're loaded? Impossible!

You can't. So, how can you do it? The basic trick that ClickOnce uses is, you
have a folder of EXEs and DLLs, and an Application Shortcut. When ClickOnce
goes to update its stuff, it builds a completely *new* folder of binaries,
then the last thing it does is rewrite the app shortcut to point to the new
folder.

So, to that end, the installation root really only needs to consist of two
folders:

```
  \packages
    MyCoolApp-1.0.nupkg
    MyCoolApp-1.1-delta.nupkg
    MyCoolApp-1.1.nupkg   ## Generated from 1.0+1.1-delta
  \app-[version]
```

Packages is effectively immutable, it simply consists of the packages we've
downloaded. This means however, that we need write-access to our own install
directory - this is fine for per-user installs, but if the user has installed
to Program Files, we'll need to come up with another solution. And that
solution is, "Only support per-user installs".

## The Update process, from start to finish

### Syncing the packages directory

The first thing that the Shimmer client will do to start the updates process, is
download the remote version of "Releases". Comparing this file to the Releases
file on disk will tell us whether an update is available.

Determining whether to use the delta packages or not will depend on the
download size - the updater will take the smaller of "latest full package" vs.
"Sum of all delta packages between current and latest". The updater makes a
choice, then fetches down all the files and checks them against the SHA1s in
the Releases file.

If the installer decided to do a Delta update, it will then use the Delta
updates against the existing Full package to build a new Full package.

### Installing a full update

Since we've done the prep work to create a new NuGet package from the deltas,
the actual update process only has to deal with full NuGet packages. This is
as simple as:

1. Extract the NuGet package to a temp dir
1. Move lib\net40 to \app-[newversion]
1. Rewrite the shortcut to point to \app-[newversion]

On next startup, we blow away \app-[version] since it's now the previous
version of the code.

### What do we do on Setup? (Bootstrapping)

Since the WiX setup application is too dumb to setup our default directory, in
order to simplify trying to bootstrap our app directory, we'll just recreate
it. This is some wasted bandwidth, but oh well. If the packages or app root
doesn't actually exist, we'll download the latest full release and set up the
app.

### Client-side API

Referencing Shimmer.Client.dll, `UpdateManager` is all the app dev needs to use.

    UpdateManager
        UpdateInfo CheckForUpdates()
        UpdateInfo DownloadUpdate()
        List<string> ApplyUpdates()
		
`UpdateInfo` contains information about pending updates if there is
any, and is null if there isn't.

    UpdateInfo
        ReleaseEntry CurrentlyInstalledVersion
        ReleaseEntry FutureReleaseEntry
        IEnumerable<ReleaseEntry> ReleasesToApply

And `ReleaseEntry` contains the specifics of each release:

    ReleaseEntry
        string SHA1
        string Filename
        long Filesize
        bool IsDelta

## Applying Updates

#### A note about Reactive Extensions

Shimmer uses Reactive Extensions (Rx) heavily as the process necessary to
retrieve, download and apply updates is best done asynchronously. If you
are using the `Microsoft.Bcl.Async` package (which Shimmer also uses) you
can combine the Rx APIs with the TPL async/await keywords, for maximum
simplicity.

### Check yourself

First, check the location where your application updates are hosted:

```
var updateManager = new UpdateManager(@"C:\Users\brendanforster\Desktop\TestApp",
                                     "TestApp",
                                     FrameworkVersion.Net40);

var updateInfo = await updateManager.CheckForUpdate();

if (updateInfo == null) {
    Console.WriteLine("No updates found");
} else if (!info.ReleasesToApply.Any()) {
        Console.WriteLine("You're up to date!"); 
} else {
    var latest = info.ReleasesToApply.MaxBy(x => x.Version).First();
    Console.WriteLine("You can update to {0}", latest.Version);
}
```

Depending on the result you get from this operation, you might:

 - not detect any updates
 - be on the latest version
 - have one or more versions to apply

### Fetch all the Updates

The result from `CheckForUpdates` will contain a list of releases to apply to
your current application.

That result becomes the input to `DownloadReleases`:

```
var releases = updateInfo.ReleasesToApply;

await updateManager.DownloadReleases(releases);
```

### Apply dem Updates

And lastly, once those updates have been downloaded, tell Shimmer to apply them:

```
var results = await updateManager.ApplyReleases(downloadedUpdateInfo);
updateManager.Dispose(); // don't forget to tidy up after yourself
```
