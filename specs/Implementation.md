# Implementation 

## Major Pieces

We need:

- A client library, which includes the core update logic
- An executable / PowerShell script to implement `New-Release`
- The actual Setup.exe that Create-Release hacks up, as well as any related
  implementation (WiX stuff?) that we need.

## Production / "Server Side"

### The tricky part

Ironically, the difficulty of using NuGet packages as a distribution container
for your app, is *if your app uses NuGet*. This is because NuGet (with good
reason!) packages the *list* of dependencies, not the actual binaries. So, if
we were to try to use the NuGet package of the App directly, we'd be missing a
bunch of DLLs.

So, we need an application that can *flatten* a NuGet dependency tree and
repack the package with all the DLLs. While this is a lot of steps, it's
actually pretty straightforward:

1. Extract the App's NuGet package to a temp directory.
1. Walk the list of dependencies. For each dependency, extract it on top of
   the temp directory (i.e. so that its `lib/*` ends up in the App's dir)
1. Recursively do the same thing (i.e. recurse down the dependency tree)
1. Edit the root NuGet package XML and remove all its explicit dependencies.

This is kind of the moral equivalent of the Rails Gem "vendor freeze" I guess.

### Delta Packages

Now, once we've got a full package, we need to generate a Delta package. To do
this, we'll replace all the DLL/EXEs in the NuGet packages with bsdiff files.
[bspatch/bsdiff](http://code.logos.com/blog/2010/12/binary_patching_with_bsdiff.html)
is a  mostly efficient algorithm for calculating diffs between binary files
(especially Native binaries, but it works well for .NET ones too), and a way
to apply them.

So, this is pretty easy:

1. Extract the previous NuGet package
1. Extract the current NuGet package
1. Replace every EXE/DLL with the bsdiff. So, `lib\net40\MyCoolApp.exe`
   becomes `lib\net40\MyCoolApp.exe.diff`. Create a file that contains a SHA1
   of the expected resulting file and its filesize called
   `lib\net40\MyCoolApp.exe.shasum`
1. New DLLs in current get put in verbatim
1. Zip it back up

The .shasum file has the same format as the Releases file described in the
"'Latest' Pointer" section, except that it will only have one entry.

So now we've got all of the *metadata* of the original package, just none of
its *contents*. To get the final package, we do the following:

1. Take the previous version, expand it out
1. Take the delta version, do the same
1. For each DLL in the previous package, we bspatch it, then check the shasum
   file to ensure we created the correct resulting file
1. If we find a DLL in the new package, just copy it over
1. If we can't find a bspatch for a file, nuke it (it doesn't exist in the new
   rev)
1. Zip it back up

### ChangeLogs / Release Notes

To write release notes for each release, we're going to reuse the
`<ReleaseNotes>` NuSpec element. However, we're going to standard that you
can write Markdown in this element, and as part of generating a flattened
package, we will render this Markdown as HTML.

### "Latest" Pointer

One of the last things we do before finishing `Create-Release` is that we
write out a simple "Releases" file alongside the flattened and Delta NuGet
packages. This is a text file that has the name of all of the release package
filenames in the folder in release order (i.e. oldest at top, newest at
bottom), along with the SHA1 hashes of their contents and their file sizes.
So, something like:

```
  94689fede03fed7ab59c24337673a27837f0c3ec  MyCoolApp-1.0.nupkg  1004502
  3a2eadd15dd984e4559f2b4d790ec8badaeb6a39  MyCoolApp-1.1.nupkg  1040561
  14db31d2647c6d2284882a2e101924a9c409ee67  MyCoolApp-1.1-delta.nupkg  80396
```

This format has a number of advantages - it's dead simple, yet enables us to
check for package corruption, as well as makes it efficient to determine what
to do if a user gets multiple versions behind (i.e. whether it's worth it to
download all of the delta packages to catch them up, or to just download the
latest full package)
