# NSync: It's like ClickOnce but Works™

### What Do We Want?

Deployment and Updates for Desktop applications blow. ClickOnce almost works,
but has some glaring bugs that don't seem like they'll ever be fixed. So let's
own our own future and build a new one.

Windows apps should be as fast and as easy to install and update as apps like
Google Chrome. From an app developer's side, it should be really
straightforward to create an installer for my app, and publish updates to it,
without having to jump through insane hoops

###### Installation

* Install is Wizard-Free™ and doesn't look awful (or at least, it should have
  the *possibility* to not look awful)
* No UAC dialogs, which means....
* ...installs to the local user account (i.e. under `%LocalAppData%`)
* Uninstall gives a chance for the application to clean up (i.e. I get to run
  a chunk of code on uninstall)
* No Reboots, for fuck's sake.
* Can pull down the .NET Framework if need be

###### Updates

* Updates should be able to be applied while the application is running
* At no time should the user ever be forced to stop what he or she is doing
* No Reboots, for fuck's sake.
* The client API should be able to check for updates, receive a (preferably in
  HTML) ChangeLog

###### Production

* Generating an installer given an existing .NET application should be really
  easy, like it is for ClickOnce
* Hosting an update server should be really straightforward as well, and
  should be able to be done using simple HTTP (i.e. I should be able to host
  my installer and update feed via S3)
* Creating an update for my app should be a very simple process that is easily
  automated
* Support for multiple "channels" (a-la Chrome Dev/Beta/Release)
